- **Embedded Python**: Bundled Python runtime for offline operation

## Prerequisites

Before building AnaFis, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust**: Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Node.js & npm**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for the embedded Python runtime (automatically bundled in releases)

## Installation & Development

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CokieMiner/Anafis-Tauri.git
cd Anafis-Tauri
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
cd AnaFis
npm install
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run tauri dev
```
This will launch the AnaFis application with hot-reloading enabled for development.

### Building for Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run tauri build
```
The built application will be available in `src-tauri/target/release/` (platform-specific).

## Usage

1. **Launch AnaFis** using the development or built executable
2. **Home Tab**: Use the central hub to create new analysis tabs
3. **Work with Tabs**: Each tab provides specialized tools:
   - **Spreadsheet**: Enter data, use formulas with Python/SymPy integration
   - **Fitting**: Import data and perform curve fitting with visualization
   - **Solver**: Input equations and get step-by-step solutions
   - **Monte Carlo**: Set up and run probabilistic simulations
4. **Detach Tabs**: Drag any tab outside the main window for flexible multi-tasking
5. **Uncertainty Calculator**: Access via the toolbar for quick calculations
6. **Settings**: Customize the application behavior and appearance

## Architecture

AnaFis follows a modern architecture separating concerns:

- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript application handling UI and user interactions
- **Backend**: Rust application managing system operations, Python integration, and IPC
- **State Management**: Zustand store for tab management and application state
- **Communication**: Tauri's IPC system for secure frontend-backend communication
- **Python Runtime**: Embedded Python environment for mathematical computations
